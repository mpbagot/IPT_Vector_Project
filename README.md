# IPT Vector Graphics Project

This project is a simple system developed as part of my Preliminary IPT Course.
It is a simple system designed to teach students the basics of the Adobe Illustrator platform in terms of using it to develop Vector Graphics for use on laser cutters.

A live version of this system is available at:
tick-it-media.tk:8721

New teacher accounts on the live site must sign up with the class password as dd78ddec.

Setup Instructions:
This system relies on a single external dependency, Pillow.

Pillow:
 - pip3 install Pillow

To run the main server, simply run:
 - python3 main.py
